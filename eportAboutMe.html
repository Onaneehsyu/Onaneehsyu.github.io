        Hello to everyone who's reading this right now. I hope you 
        and your loved ones are in a great and wonderful condition. My name 
        is Sheen Cyril Durens. I am 35 years of age from Bulua, Cagayan
        de Oro City, Misamis Oriental. I was born in Cebu City, Cebu and lived
        there until I was 10 years old and after that my family moved here
        in Cagayan de Oro City where I haved lived most of my life. I am the 
        oldest of 3 sons of Claro and Francia Durens. I am already married to
        Geraldine Lagunay Durens and we currently have a bouncing baby boy named Zhyler. <br><br>
        
        I worked previously as a Vehicle Insurance Authentication Agent at a small
        vehicle insurance business owned by one of my parent's friends and then I
        went back to Cebu City in the year 2016 to work as a Technical Support Assistant
        and a Customer Sales Representative with different call center businesses there.
        Currently I am looking for an online work opportunity because of the ongoing 
        pandemic that is why I decided to enroll in KodeGo so that I can learn more about
        Web Development which is on of the most in-demand jobs that most people can work in
        the comfort of their own homes. <br><br>

        My hobbies are reading, writing, watching movies, listening to music, singing, dancing, and
        playing mobile and PC games. At my free time I entertain my 5 month old son by singing and dancing
        for him. I also help my wife with the household chores like cooking and washing dishes/clothes.
        I am also very active in our Church activities since I am the Chairman of the married couples
        in our Church. Even with so many things I should do daily, I still try to balance
        everything in the best of my ability. <br><br>

        I am very shy at first but when you get to know me you'll see I can be a very
        fun person to be with. I love to make people laugh and happy. I can make jokes,
        sing, dance, be a clown. I don't talk too much but if friends want someone to lend
        an ear, I am also a great listener and very empathic. I am not perfect, I too have
        flaws but that is not keeping me from being a good buddy to my friends. <br><br>

        I believe everyone has a chance to change his life for the better if he/she wills it.
        Life might sometimes be tough and you won't get what you want right away but someday
        you'll get what you wanted or dreamed of as long as you don't quit on yourself. <br><br>
